## Important Notes
- **Must use XCode**
- Once downloaded or pulled, the project folder will be ``myvirtualpet``. This is okay because we changed our app name towards the end of development and did not want to change it in case of any errors.
- In the case where there is an audio error, open the Reality Composer by clicking on ``Experience`` and then ``Open in Reality Composer``. Next, click on ``Behaviors`` on the top right and click on ``Scene Start Music``. Under ``Action Sequence`` -> ``Audio Clip``, click on ``Replace`` and download all the ``Animals`` sounds.
- **This error is a result of individual XCodes not downloading these sounds before, we are not able to have these sounds downloaded when exporting this project.**

## How to access
- Download the zip source file directly.
- Once you unzip the folder, find the folder and open `myvirtualpet` in XCode and launch with a connected iPhone. **The simulated iPhone 12 in XCode cannot launch the AR scene of the game.**
- In XCode, click on the `myvirtualpet` project source and go to **Signing & Capabilities**. If you have not already, you must put yourself in **Team**.  
- On the iPhone, the app will install onto your home page and you must go to **Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management** and allow the app to be launched.
